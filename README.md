# Front-End-Class-Project

Louie has the best pizza in town, but his small pizza shop is only known to some die-hard local fans. Louie wants to expand his business and attract new customers so that more people can enjoy his amazing pizza. Louie has contracted you to build a website for "Louie's Pizza" and he has provided you with a PDF with what he wants the final product to look like. You will build a site that matches Louie's design in phases, with the final product being a marketing site that will help Louie grow his business.
